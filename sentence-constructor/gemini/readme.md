# Updated README: Iterative Testing with Gemini 2.0 (Advanced and Flash)

## Overview

This document captures the results and insights from testing the language translation tutor prompt with Gemini 2.0 Advanced and Flash models. The prompt was designed for translating English sentences into target languages (French, Japanese, and Arabic) while guiding users through vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar considerations without directly providing translations.

The testing focused on evaluating adherence to the prompt's strict instructions and comparing performance across the Gemini versions.

## Testing Process

- **Prompt Used:** The same refined prompt from ChatGPT 4o testing was applied without modification.
- **Target Languages:** French, Japanese, Arabic.
- **Models Tested:** Gemini 2.0 Advanced and Gemini 2.0 Flash.

For each test, the output was evaluated based on four sections:
1. Vocabulary Cheatsheet
2. Expected Sentence Structure
3. Considerations
4. Next Steps

## Results Summary

### **1. French Outputs**

#### **Gemini 2.0 Advanced**
- **Vocabulary Cheatsheet:** Correct words from the English sentence were included. Proper dictionary forms and French accents were applied.
- **Expected Sentence Structure:** Followed placeholders and aligned with French grammar.
- **Considerations:** Clear and actionable, avoiding unnecessary French words or direct translations.
- **Next Steps:** Provided actionable hints, maintaining a learning focus.

**Verdict:** Fully compliant.

#### **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
- **Vocabulary Cheatsheet:** Correct words were listed, but minor inconsistencies in formatting were observed (e.g., inconsistent capitalization).
- **Expected Sentence Structure:** Accurate and aligned with French grammar.
- **Considerations:** Avoided direct French words; clear and concise grammar insights.
- **Next Steps:** Clear and actionable.

**Verdict:** Mostly compliant, with minor formatting inconsistencies.

### **2. Japanese Outputs**

#### **Gemini 2.0 Advanced**
- **Vocabulary Cheatsheet:** Correct words included, but Japanese dictionary forms were not written in kanji/hiragana. Romanized forms were used instead, which is less ideal for learners.
- **Expected Sentence Structure:** Correctly structured placeholders, aligned with Japanese SOV grammar.
- **Considerations:** Clear and insightful, but occasionally included Japanese words (e.g., "wa" and "ga").
- **Next Steps:** Clear and actionable.

**Verdict:** Partially compliant. Lack of kanji/hiragana and inclusion of Japanese words in considerations require improvement.

#### **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
- **Vocabulary Cheatsheet:** Same issue as Advancedâ€”only romanized forms, no kanji/hiragana.
- **Expected Sentence Structure:** Accurate placeholders and grammar alignment.
- **Considerations:** Included Japanese words (e.g., "ka"), which deviates from strict rules.
- **Next Steps:** Clear and actionable.

**Verdict:** Partially compliant. Issues with vocabulary format and inclusion of Japanese words persist.

### **3. Arabic Outputs**

#### **Gemini 2.0 Advanced**
- **Vocabulary Cheatsheet:** Correct words and Arabic script provided. Proper dictionary forms were used.
- **Expected Sentence Structure:** Accurate placeholders aligned with Arabic grammar.
- **Considerations:** Clear grammar insights without unnecessary Arabic words.
- **Next Steps:** Provided actionable guidance.

**Verdict:** Fully compliant.

#### **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
- **Vocabulary Cheatsheet:** Correct words and Arabic script provided. Dictionary forms were accurate.
- **Expected Sentence Structure:** Accurate placeholders aligned with Arabic grammar.
- **Considerations:** Clear grammar insights, though slightly verbose in some cases.
- **Next Steps:** Clear and actionable.

**Verdict:** Fully compliant.

## Key Observations

1. **Gemini 2.0 Advanced:**
   - Performed well across all languages, with only minor issues for Japanese (romanized forms and occasional Japanese words in considerations).

2. **Gemini 2.0 Flash:**
   - Consistently performed well but shared the same Japanese-specific issues as Advanced.
   - French outputs showed minor formatting inconsistencies in the vocabulary table.

3. **Japanese Vocabulary:**
   - Both models failed to provide kanji/hiragana forms, opting for romanized representations. This does not align with the prompt's goal of using native scripts.

4. **Strict Adherence:**
   - Both models generally adhered to the rules, but minor deviations (e.g., using target-language words in considerations) were noted, particularly for Japanese.

---

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Address Japanese Vocabulary Issues:**
   - Ensure kanji/hiragana are included in the vocabulary cheatsheet for Japanese outputs.

2. **Re-test French Outputs on Flash:**
   - Resolve minor formatting inconsistencies in the vocabulary table.

3. **Expand Testing:**
   - Test additional target languages (e.g., Spanish, German) to validate robustness.

4. **Enhance Prompt for Japanese:**
   - Explicitly enforce the use of native scripts in the vocabulary cheatsheet.

5. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Continue refining the prompt based on model-specific outputs to ensure consistent behavior across LLMs.

## Conclusion

The refined prompt demonstrates strong adaptability and compliance across Gemini 2.0 Advanced and Flash versions. While Arabic and French outputs were highly compliant, Japanese outputs require minor adjustments to fully meet expectations. Further testing and refinements will help extend this framework to additional languages and improve overall robustness.
