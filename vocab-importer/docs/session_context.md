# Vocab Importer Development Session Context

## Initial Requirements & Scope
- Build internal tool for generating/importing vocabulary lists
- Support for Japanese, French, Arabic, Spanish (extensible to other languages)
- Strictly follow technical specifications in tech-specs/technical-specs.md
- Use Streamlit exclusively unless absolutely necessary
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Focus on single-user prototype with file-based storage

## AI Assistant Role & Responsibilities
- Lead the development while explaining actions and decisions
- Maintain test coverage and documentation
- Suggest commits at logical points
- Update implementation plan as we progress
- Proactively identify potential issues or improvements

### Active Development State
- Phase 2.2 (File Management) completed with single-file-per-category system
- File operations include automatic merging and backups
- Comprehensive test coverage for file operations
- Ready to begin LLM integration

### Pending Actions
1. **Immediate**:
   - Review existing prompts in prompt_generation_by_chatgtp-03-mini
   - Design prompt template system
   - Set up LLM API client
   - Implement retry logic for API calls

2. **Short-term**:
   - Create test mocks for LLM interactions
   - Implement vocabulary generation interface
   - Add error handling for API failures

3. **To Discuss**:
   - Preferred LLM provider for initial development
   - Retry strategy for API failures
   - Prompt template structure

### Technical Decisions & Rationale
1. **File Management System**:
   - Single file per language+category for simplicity
   - Automatic merging to prevent duplicates
   - Backup system for safe operations
   - UTF-8 encoding for proper character support

2. **JSON Validation System**:
   - Using jsonschema for robust schema validation
   - Strict typing and required field enforcement
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Support for file merging with duplicate prevention

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - File operation tests with temporary directories
   - Edge case coverage
   - Mock data for all supported languages

4. **Streamlit-only UI**:
   - Reason: Rapid prototyping requirement
   - Impact: Shapes component structure and state management

5. **Multiple LLM Support**:
   - Providers: Groq, OpenAI, Gemini
   - Reason: Compare output quality and costs
   - Impact: Modular LLM integration needed

6. **JSON File Storage**:
   - Reason: Single-user prototype requirement
   - Structure: One file per word category
   - Format: Strictly following tech specs schema

### Development Guidelines
1. **Testing**:
   - All features require tests
   - Mock LLM interactions in tests
   - Include UI component testing

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update technical specs when adding features
   - Maintain implementation plan status
   - Document all LLM prompts

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Modular components in `components/`
   - Utility functions in `utils/`
   - Clear separation of concerns
