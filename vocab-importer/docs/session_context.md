### Active Development State
- LLM client implementation complete with multiple provider support
- Prompt templates created and ready for testing
- File management system complete with single-file-per-category approach
- Ready to integrate LLM client with prompt management

### Pending Actions
1. **Immediate**:
   - Integrate LLM client with prompt management system
   - Add retry logic for API failures
   - Create vocabulary generation interface
   - Add response validation against JSON schema

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement vocabulary generation interface
   - Add error handling for API failures
   - Create comprehensive test suite for LLM integration

3. **To Discuss**:
   - Preferred LLM provider for initial development
   - Retry strategy for API failures
   - Error handling approach for malformed LLM responses

### Technical Decisions & Rationale
1. **LLM Client System**:
   - Multiple provider support (Groq, OpenAI, Gemini)
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Consistent error handling and response parsing
   - Modular design for easy extension

2. **Prompt Template System**:
   - Base template with language-specific extensions
   - Simple diversity requirement to avoid duplicate words
   - Maintained compatibility with tested prompts
   - Parametrized fields for flexibility

3. **File Management System**:
   - Single file per language+category for simplicity
   - Automatic merging to prevent duplicates
   - Backup system for safe operations
   - UTF-8 encoding for proper character support

4. **JSON Validation System**:
   - Using jsonschema for robust schema validation
   - Strict typing and required field enforcement
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Support for file merging with duplicate prevention

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - File operation tests with temporary directories
   - Edge case coverage
   - Mock data for all supported languages

6. **Streamlit-only UI**:
   - Reason: Rapid prototyping requirement
   - Impact: Shapes component structure and state management

7. **Multiple LLM Support**:
   - Providers: Groq, OpenAI, Gemini
   - Reason: Compare output quality and costs
   - Impact: Modular LLM integration needed

8. **JSON File Storage**:
   - Reason: Single-user prototype requirement
   - Structure: One file per word category
   - Format: Strictly following tech specs schema

### Development Guidelines
1. **Testing**:
   - All features require tests
   - Mock LLM interactions in tests
   - Include UI component testing

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update technical specs when adding features
   - Maintain implementation plan status
   - Document all LLM prompts

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Modular components in `components/`
   - Utility functions in `utils/`
   - Clear separation of concerns
