### Active Development State
- Templates improved and verified for all languages
- Vocabulary generation working correctly
- File management system handling merges properly
- Documentation updated to reflect latest changes

### Pending Actions
1. **Immediate**:
   - Add retry logic for API failures
   - Create vocabulary generation interface
   - Implement responsive UI layout

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement vocabulary generation UI
   - Add error handling for API failures
   - Create comprehensive test suite for UI components

3. **To Discuss**:
   - UI layout and styling approach
   - Error handling strategy for API failures
   - User feedback during vocabulary generation

### Technical Decisions & Rationale
1. **Template Improvements**:
   - Added detailed pronunciation guides
   - Enhanced syllable segmentation rules
   - Included common patterns and examples
   - Reason: Improve consistency and accuracy
   - Impact: Better quality vocabulary generation

2. **Vocabulary Generation**:
   - Verified across all languages
   - Confirmed proper segmentation
   - Validated pronunciation aids
   - Reason: Ensure template improvements work
   - Impact: Higher quality output

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated implementation plan
   - Enhanced LLM iterations document
   - Maintained session context
   - Reason: Track progress and insights
   - Impact: Better project continuity

4. **LLM Client System**:
   - Multiple provider support (Groq, OpenAI, Gemini)
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Consistent error handling
   - Reason: Flexibility and reliability
   - Impact: Robust vocabulary generation

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - File operation tests with temporary directories
   - Edge case coverage
   - Mock data for all supported languages

6. **Streamlit-only UI**:
   - Reason: Rapid prototyping requirement
   - Impact: Shapes component structure and state management

7. **Multiple LLM Support**:
   - Providers: Groq, OpenAI, Gemini
   - Reason: Compare output quality and costs
   - Impact: Modular LLM integration needed

8. **JSON File Storage**:
   - Reason: Single-user prototype requirement
   - Structure: One file per word category
   - Format: Strictly following tech specs schema

### Development Guidelines
1. **Testing**:
   - All features require tests
   - Mock LLM interactions in tests
   - Include UI component testing

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update technical specs when adding features
   - Maintain implementation plan status
   - Document all LLM prompts

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Modular components in `components/`
   - Utility functions in `utils/`
   - Clear separation of concerns
