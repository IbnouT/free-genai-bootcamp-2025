# Vocab Importer Development Session Context

## Initial Requirements & Scope
- Build internal tool for generating/importing vocabulary lists
- Support for Japanese, French, Arabic, Spanish (extensible to other languages)
- Strictly follow technical specifications in tech-specs/technical-specs.md
- Use Streamlit exclusively unless absolutely necessary
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Focus on single-user prototype with file-based storage

## AI Assistant Role & Responsibilities
- Lead the development while explaining actions and decisions
- Maintain test coverage and documentation
- Suggest commits at logical points
- Update implementation plan as we progress
- Proactively identify potential issues or improvements

## Project Status

### Current Phase
- Working on Phase 3.1 (UI Implementation)
- Last completed: Phase 1.1 (Initial Setup)

### Latest Commit
```
[Vocab Importer][Phase 1.1] Initial project setup

- Created project structure with Streamlit-aligned organization
- Added basic requirements.txt with core dependencies
- Created Streamlit configuration template
- Added basic app.py for testing setup
- Created comprehensive README and .gitignore
- Added implementation plan
```

### Active Development State
- UI enhancement changes prepared but not committed
- Virtual environment active and dependencies installed
- Basic Streamlit app functional
- Multiple LLM providers configured in secrets template

### Pending Actions
1. **Immediate**:
   - Commit UI enhancements
   - Update implementation plan checkmarks
   - Add tests for basic UI components

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement JSON validation
   - Set up LLM integration
   - Create test data

3. **To Discuss**:
   - Preferred LLM provider for initial development
   - Test strategy for LLM interactions
   - Error handling approach

### Technical Decisions & Rationale
1. **Streamlit-only UI**:
   - Reason: Rapid prototyping requirement
   - Impact: Shapes component structure and state management

2. **Multiple LLM Support**:
   - Providers: Groq, OpenAI, Gemini
   - Reason: Compare output quality and costs
   - Impact: Modular LLM integration needed

3. **JSON File Storage**:
   - Reason: Single-user prototype requirement
   - Structure: One file per word category
   - Format: Strictly following tech specs schema

### Development Guidelines
1. **Testing**:
   - All features require tests
   - Mock LLM interactions in tests
   - Include UI component testing

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update technical specs when adding features
   - Maintain implementation plan status
   - Document all LLM prompts

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Modular components in `components/`
   - Utility functions in `utils/`
   - Clear separation of concerns
