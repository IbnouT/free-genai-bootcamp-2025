# Vocab Importer Development Session Context

## Initial Requirements & Scope
- Build internal tool for generating/importing vocabulary lists
- Support for Japanese, French, Arabic, Spanish (extensible to other languages)
- Strictly follow technical specifications in tech-specs/technical-specs.md
- Use Streamlit exclusively unless absolutely necessary
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Focus on single-user prototype with file-based storage

## AI Assistant Role & Responsibilities
- Lead the development while explaining actions and decisions
- Maintain test coverage and documentation
- Suggest commits at logical points
- Update implementation plan as we progress
- Proactively identify potential issues or improvements

## Project Status

### Current Phase
- Completed Phase 2.1 (JSON Structure Validation)
- Ready to begin Phase 2.2 (File Management)

### Latest Commits
1. ```

```

4. ```
[Vocab Importer][Phase 3.1] Enhance UI with modern design

- Added gradient header with improved typography
- Implemented card-based layout with action buttons
- Created statistics dashboard with responsive design
- Added language selection with flags in sidebar
- Included quick stats and recent activity sections
- Added custom CSS for consistent styling
```

### Active Development State
- Phase 2.1 (JSON Structure Validation) completed with comprehensive validation system
- All UI components separated into individual files
- Dark theme and responsive layout implemented
- Ready to begin implementing file management system

### Pending Actions
1. **Immediate**:
   - Implement file naming convention
   - Create file storage utilities
   - Add file operation tests

2. **Short-term**:
   - Set up LLM integration
   - Create test data
   - Implement vocabulary generation interface

3. **To Discuss**:
   - File storage structure preferences
   - Backup strategy for vocabulary files
   - Error handling approach for file operations

### Technical Decisions & Rationale
1. **JSON Validation System**:
   - Using jsonschema for robust schema validation
   - Strict typing and required field enforcement
   - Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
   - Support for file merging with duplicate prevention

2. **File Operations**:
   - UTF-8 encoding for proper character support
   - JSON pretty printing for readability
   - Atomic file operations for safety
   - Validation before any file operation

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all validators
   - File operation tests with temporary files
   - Edge case coverage for validation
   - Mock data for all supported languages

4. **Streamlit-only UI**:
   - Reason: Rapid prototyping requirement
   - Impact: Shapes component structure and state management

5. **Multiple LLM Support**:
   - Providers: Groq, OpenAI, Gemini
   - Reason: Compare output quality and costs
   - Impact: Modular LLM integration needed

6. **JSON File Storage**:
   - Reason: Single-user prototype requirement
   - Structure: One file per word category
   - Format: Strictly following tech specs schema

### Development Guidelines
1. **Testing**:
   - All features require tests
   - Mock LLM interactions in tests
   - Include UI component testing

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update technical specs when adding features
   - Maintain implementation plan status
   - Document all LLM prompts

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Modular components in `components/`
   - Utility functions in `utils/`
   - Clear separation of concerns
