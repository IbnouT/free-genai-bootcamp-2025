# Feasibility Analysis

## 1. Rapid Prototyping with Streamlit
- **Streamlit** is an excellent choice for an internal-facing tool.  
- It allows for quick development of interactive web apps with minimal overhead.  
- This means we can rapidly iterate on generating enriched vocab lists using the managed LLM API and handle JSON file import/export without a complex frontend–backend separation.

## 2. Integration with Managed LLM API (GroqCloud)
- Leveraging a managed API like **GroqCloud** avoids the complexities of self-hosting an LLM.  
- By integrating via an API key, we can easily test and plug in the generation process within our Streamlit app.  
- This approach supports rapid prototyping without long deployment cycles.

## 3. JSON File Handling and Persistence
- The tool will support both exporting and importing vocab JSON files.  
- We can adopt a consistent schema across languages, capturing essential details (e.g., original script, transliteration, meaning) based on our existing backend models :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
- For the prototype, storing files in a designated folder is sufficient, with the option to later integrate with a SQLite database if needed.

## 4. Multi-Language Support with Rich Vocab Format
- The design accommodates target languages like **Japanese, French, Arabic, and Spanish** with unique requirements (e.g., script details for Japanese).  
- A flexible JSON structure can capture additional attributes for different languages while maintaining a uniform format.  
- Sample screenshots (used as guidance) help inform the enriched format for learning vocabulary.

## 5. Development Simplicity and Robustness
- Using Streamlit minimizes boilerplate code and facilitates rapid iteration.  
- The internal tool is designed to be simple, focusing on generating, exporting, and importing JSON files while being robust enough for integration with our existing backend and frontend specs :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} and implementation plan :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

## 6. Scalability Considerations
- Although the current focus is on a managed LLM API, the design can later support local LLM integration via OPEA.  
- Designing with an abstraction for the LLM component (e.g., via dependency injection) will allow easy swapping or addition of new LLM options in the future.

# Summary
- **High Feasibility:** Leveraging Streamlit and a managed LLM API enables fast, efficient prototyping.
- **Consistency & Extensibility:** Aligning the vocab JSON format with backend models ensures consistency and facilitates future enhancements.
- **Simple yet Robust:** The tool’s design is simple for quick development but robust enough to integrate with our larger language learning portal.

This approach is feasible within the prototype constraints and meets the business goals as outlined.
