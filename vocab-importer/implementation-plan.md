# Vocab Importer Implementation Plan

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the steps to build the Vocab Importer tool, a Streamlit-based application for generating and managing vocabulary lists for multiple languages (Japanese, French, Arabic, Spanish) with potential for expansion to other languages.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All phases completed
- [ ] 100% test coverage achieved
- [ ] Documentation updated

  - [x] Set up basic project directories (src, tests, data)
- [x] 1.2. Set up testing framework
  - [x] Configure pytest with coverage reporting in pytest.ini
  - [x] Set up test structure with fixtures and helpers
  - [x] Create initial UI component tests
  - [x] Configure coverage thresholds and exclusions

## Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [x] 2.1. JSON Structure Validation
  - [x] Create simple JSON structure validators
  - [x] Implement validation helpers for import/export
  - [x] Write tests for validation functions
- [ ] 2.2. File Management
  - [ ] Implement file naming convention
  - [ ] Create file storage utilities
  - [ ] Write tests for file operations
- [ ] 2.3. LLM Integration
  - [ ] Review and convert existing prompts to templates
  - [ ] Set up LLM API client
  - [ ] Create prompt template management
  - [ ] Write tests for LLM integration

## Phase 3: Streamlit UI Implementation
- [x] 3.1. Basic UI Layout
  - [x] Create main page structure
  - [x] Implement language selection
  - [x] Implement category input/selection
  - [x] Create modular component structure
  - [x] Implement dark theme styling
  - [ ] Add responsive layout with proper spacing
- [ ] 3.2. Vocabulary Generation UI
  - [ ] Create generation interface
  - [ ] Implement progress indicators
  - [ ] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] 3.3. Review & Edit Interface
  - [ ] Create vocabulary entry editor
  - [ ] Implement batch operations
  - [ ] Add validation feedback

## Phase 4: Import/Export Features
- [ ] 4.1. Export Functionality
  - [ ] Implement JSON export
  - [ ] Add file naming logic with random elements
  - [ ] Create export progress indicators
- [ ] 4.2. Import Functionality
  - [ ] Create file upload interface
  - [ ] Implement validation
  - [ ] Add merge capabilities for existing categories

## Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] 5.1. Integration Tests
  - [ ] Write end-to-end tests
  - [ ] Create test data sets
- [ ] 5.2. Documentation
  - [ ] Update technical specifications if needed
  - [ ] Create user guide
  - [ ] Document functions and features

## Phase 6: Deployment & Final Polish
- [ ] 6.1. Deployment Setup
  - [ ] Create deployment documentation
  - [ ] Set up environment configuration
- [ ] 6.2. Final Testing
  - [ ] Perform security review
  - [ ] Run performance tests
- [ ] 6.3. Release Preparation
  - [ ] Create release notes
  - [ ] Prepare deployment package

## Commit Strategy
We will commit changes at logical points:
1. After completing each sub-phase
2. When adding new features
3. After significant test additions
4. When updating documentation

Each commit will have a descriptive message following the format:
```
[Vocab Importer][Phase X.Y] Brief description

- Detailed point 1
- Detailed point 2
```

## Notes
- The tool will use Streamlit exclusively for the UI
- JSON files will be used for data storage
- Existing prompts from prompt_generation_by_chatgtp-03-mini will be converted to templates
- Testing will aim for 100% coverage
- All functionality will be tested manually before marking as complete
