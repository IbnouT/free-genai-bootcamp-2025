## Testing Evolution

### Initial Approach
- Started with basic unit tests for core functionality
- **Challenge**: Needed comprehensive testing for Streamlit components
- **Solution**: Created reusable mock fixtures and helpers
- **Learning**: Good test infrastructure enables faster development

### Test Coverage Strategy
1. **Core Components First**
   - Started with vocabulary generator
   - Focused on critical functionality
   - Achieved 98% coverage for core component

2. **Mock Implementation**
   - Created comprehensive mock_streamlit fixture
   - Used monkeypatch for reliable mocking
   - Added context manager support
   - Implemented session state management

3. **Test Organization**
   - Grouped related test cases
   - Added detailed documentation
   - Created helper fixtures
   - Maintained test readability

### Context Management
1. **Session State Testing**
   - **Challenge**: Managing Streamlit's session state in tests
   - **Solution**: Created mock_session_state fixture
   - **Impact**: Reliable state management testing
   - **Learning**: State management crucial for UI testing

2. **Test Documentation**
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining clear test documentation
   - **Solution**: Added detailed test descriptions
   - **Impact**: Easier test maintenance
   - **Learning**: Good documentation helps future development
