# Session Context

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Transcript Extraction

#### Step 1: Project Setup (Completed)
- Created project structure with frontend/, backend/, and docs/ directories
- Initialized requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
- Created README.md with setup instructions
- Implemented basic transcript_extractor.py module
- Created initial Streamlit app with transcript fetching functionality
- Added .gitignore for Python project

#### Step 2: Transcript Extractor Implementation (Completed)
- Simplified transcript extraction logic to directly fetch French transcripts
- Added debug logging for video ID tracking
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Fixed issues with French transcript detection and fetching

#### Step 3: Frontend Enhancement (Completed)
- Improved UI layout with columns for better space usage
- Added styled containers for transcript display
- Enhanced visual feedback with emojis and colors
- Added video information section
- Included learning tips section
- Improved error messages and user guidance

#### Step 4: Audio Pipeline Implementation (Completed)
- Created timestamp_extractor.py for identifying sequence boundaries
- Implemented audio_segmenter.py for downloading and segmenting audio
- Created audio_transcriber.py for Whisper API integration
- Implemented data_manager.py for handling audio and transcript data
- Added ChromaDB integration for semantic search
- Updated test module to verify complete pipeline

#### Step 5: Basic Frontend for Pipeline Testing (In Progress)
- Updated app.py to focus on pipeline testing
- Added visualization for each pipeline stage
- Implemented audio playback for segments
- Added detailed output display for each stage
- Next: Test and refine the complete pipeline

### Phase 2: LLM Prompt Engineering and Data Generation

#### Step 1: LLM Integration Setup (In Progress)
- Created llm_data_generator.py module
- Implemented OpenAI API integration
- Designed initial prompt for learning content generation
- Added content validation
- Structured JSON output format

#### Step 2: Timestamp Extraction and Audio Segmentation (Completed)
- Created timestamp_extractor.py module for identifying sequence boundaries
- Implemented gap-based timestamp extraction with minimum entries requirement
- Created audio_segmenter.py for downloading and segmenting audio
- Integrated yt-dlp for reliable audio downloading
- Added audio segmentation based on extracted timestamps
- Updated .gitignore to exclude generated audio and transcript files

**Next Step:** Test and refine LLM prompt with sample transcripts

## Key Decisions
- Using Streamlit for rapid frontend development
- Implementing modular backend structure
- Using youtube-transcript-api for reliable transcript extraction
- Including type hints for better code maintainability
- Setting up environment variables for API keys
- Simplified transcript fetching to directly request French language
- Enhanced UI with custom CSS and better component organization
- Using GPT-3.5-turbo for learning content generation
- Structured JSON format for Q&A content
- Using yt-dlp instead of youtube-dl for more reliable audio downloads
- Implementing minimum entries requirement for sequence extraction to ensure meaningful content
- Using OpenAI's Whisper API for accurate French audio transcription
- Implementing comprehensive error handling and logging in audio pipeline
- Using ChromaDB for semantic search and data persistence
- Using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model for vector embeddings
- Focusing on pipeline testing before moving to advanced features
- Using expandable sections for detailed stage output
- Including audio playback for immediate verification
