# Session Context

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Transcript Extraction

#### Step 1: Project Setup (Completed)
- Created project structure with frontend/, backend/, and docs/ directories
- Initialized requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
- Created README.md with setup instructions
- Implemented basic transcript_extractor.py module
- Created initial Streamlit app with transcript fetching functionality
- Added .gitignore for Python project

#### Step 2: Transcript Extractor Implementation (Completed)
- Simplified transcript extraction logic to directly fetch French transcripts
- Added debug logging for video ID tracking
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Fixed issues with French transcript detection and fetching

**Next Step:** Phase 1, Step 3 - Enhance frontend with better transcript display

## Key Decisions
- Using Streamlit for rapid frontend development
- Implementing modular backend structure
- Using youtube-transcript-api for reliable transcript extraction
- Including type hints for better code maintainability
- Setting up environment variables for API keys
- Simplified transcript fetching to directly request French language
