## Phase 1: Setup and Basic Transcript Extraction

### Step 1: Project Setup

#### Challenges
- Setting up proper project structure for scalability
- Ensuring clean separation of frontend and backend components
- Managing Python path for backend module imports

#### Solutions
- Created clear directory structure with frontend/, backend/, and docs/
- Used Path from pathlib for reliable path handling
- Added backend directory to Python path in app.py

#### Code Quality Assessment
- Clean, well-documented code with type hints
- Proper error handling in transcript extraction
- Modular structure for easy maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend

#### Insights
- Using Streamlit's spinner and success/error messages improves UX
- TextFormatter from youtube-transcript-api provides clean transcript output
- Regular expressions for YouTube URL validation improve reliability

### Step 2: Transcript Extractor Implementation

#### Challenges
- Initial complexity in transcript fetching logic
- Issues with French transcript detection
- Multiple approaches needed to find the right solution

#### Solutions
- Simplified the transcript fetching logic
- Directly request French transcripts using language code
- Added debug logging for better troubleshooting
- Improved error handling with specific messages

#### Code Quality Assessment
- Simplified and more maintainable code
- Better error messages for users
- Reliable French transcript detection
- Debug-friendly with added logging

#### Insights
- Direct approach to transcript fetching is more reliable
- Specific language code request works better than complex fallbacks
- Debug logging helps track issues in transcript fetching
